## Installation and use

* Download the files on the [/pdf_kindle_gui](https://github.com/miltonlaufer/pythonscripts/tree/master/pdf_kindle_gui/) folder.
* Open a terminal (*Ubuntu*: 'ctrl+alt+t'; *Windows*: 'Windows+R' and then write 'cmd', press 'enter'; *Mac*... applications, maybe?), go to the folder where you put the files and:
    python pdf_kindle_gui
* From there, it's pretty intuitive. 

(There's also a one-file standalone executable release on [/pdf_kindle_gui/dist](https://github.com/miltonlaufer/pythonscripts/tree/master/pdf_kindle_gui/dist), but it only works on linux, as far as I tested it.)

# Option 2: Terminal
## (Good for batch jobs).

* Download the files on the [/pdf_kindle/](https://github.com/miltonlaufer/pythonscripts/tree/master/pdf_kindle) folder.
* Open a terminal (*Ubuntu*: 'ctrl+alt+t'; *Windows*: 'Windows+R' and then write 'cmd, press 'enter';Mac... Applications, maybe?), go to the folder where you put the files and choose one of the following options

USAGE:

    python pdfkindle.py ORIGINAL.pdf

or

    python pdfkindle.py ORIGINAL.pdf FINAL.pdf

or

    python pdfkindle.py ORIGINAL.pdf rotateClockwiseINTEGER

or

    python pdfkindle.py ORIGINAL.pdf FINAL.pdf rotateClockwiseINTEGER

(you can ommit the "python" if the file has execute permissions --i.e., "chmod +x pdfkindle")

Please remember the paths are relative, so if you have your script on "/home/myuser/", you'll need to execute this way:

    python /home/myuser/pdfkindle.py ORIGINAL.pdf

or

    python /home/myuser/pdfkindle.py /home/myuser/somepdfs/ORIGINAL.pdf

the output file will be saved on the current folder.

## BATCH JOBS:

The following splits all the PDFs on the current dir. You can add to this command any of the options from above.  

     for i in *.pdf; do python pdfkindle.py $i; done

For instance, if you want to rotate all the files 90ยบ clockwise,

     for i in *.pdf; do python pdfkindle.py $i 90; done
